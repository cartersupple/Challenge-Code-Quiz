# Challenge-Code-Quiz
## This weeks challenge was to create a code quiz! To help study and prepare for coding interviews, the task was to create an app that makes multiple choice questions. The criteria was as follows,
### WHEN I click the start button
### THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
### WHEN I answer a question
### THEN I am presented with another question
### WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
### THEN time is subtracted from the clock
### WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
### THEN the game is over
### WHEN the game is over
### THEN I can save my initials and score
