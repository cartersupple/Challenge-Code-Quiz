# Challenge-Code-Quiz
## This weeks challenge was to create a code quiz! To help study and prepare for coding interviews, the task was to create an app that makes multiple choice questions. Each time you play the order in which the questions are generated is different. When the game is over you get a score between 0 and 500, you can then enter your name to save to the local storage. When you press on the scores button, you are directed to a list of your top 5 scores.
